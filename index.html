									<p>I am a third year Computer Science student at the University of California, Davis. I am passionate about building clean, robust, and scalable software. I have industry experience with Python, Golang, Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, and Amazon Web Services. I am also proficient in Java, C/C++, and Javascript, and have experience with React, Node, Git, and MongoDB. I have previously interned at Skyflow, where I helped build an ETL datapipeline that has been shipped into production. Please feel free to reach out. Happy to discuss!</p>

										<h2>My Favorite Books</h2>
									</header>
									<p> As an avid book worm, I love to read books that change my perspective. The books I have read have shaped me in ways I never could have known when I first picked them up. Here are a few books that have influenced me the most: </p>
									 <h3> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Obstacle-Way-Timeless-Turning-Triumph/dp/1591846358"> The Obstacle is the Way </a> </h3>
									 <h4> Author: Ryan Holiday </h4>
									 <img src="images/ObstacleWay.jpeg" alt="" />
									 <p> Like many people, I sometimes beat myself up and panic over mistakes and failures. This book taught me how to control my emotions and overcome challenges I will encounter in my life. The way Holiday presents practical habits and skills for better living, along with the countless historical examples, made the book not only enjoyable but life changing. I still use many of the lessons presented in my everyday life. </p>

									 <h3> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Lives-Stoics-Living-Marcus-Aurelius/dp/052554187X"> Lives of the Stoics </a> </h3>
									 <h4> Authors: Ryan Holiday & Stephen Hanselman </h4>
									 <img src="images/LivesStoics.jpg" alt="" />
									 <p> I had thought stoics were a weird, fringe group of ancient intellectuals. This book taught me that not only was that not true, but the lessons the stoics exposed could be used to enhance the quality of my life. By the end of the book, I had made signficant changes to my system of thinking and living. It also sparked my interest in the fascinating history of Ancient Greece and Rome. </p>

									 <h3> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Paris-1919-Months-Changed-World/dp/0375760520"> Paris 1919 </a> </h3>
									 <h4> Author: Margaret MacMillan</h4>
									 <img src="images/Paris1919.jpeg" alt="" />
									 <p> I had always been curious about the history of Europe and the Middle East, and how the conflicts and passions of today were shaped by the preceding centuries. This book taught me the history of the various cultures and nations in Eurasia, as well as the unfathamable destruction and pain world war one caused. Much of my knowledge of history and the connections of past events to present issues comes from this book. </p>

									 	<h3> <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/Steal-Like-Artist-Things-Creative/dp/0761169253"> Steal Like an Artist</a> </h3>
										<h4> Author: Austin Kleon </h4>
										<img src="images/StealArtist.jpeg" alt="" />
										<p> Every creator is an artist, from a muscician to a programmer. This book brought so much inspiration and inspired me to bring out my creative side through personal projects. I have found myself repeatidly reviewing the nonintuitive ideas presented in this book. </p>
